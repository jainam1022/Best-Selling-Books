The Top 5 Authors (Total Book Sales) focuses on identifying the authors who have sold the highest total number of books across all their titles. 
This metric highlights the overall commercial success of an author based on the cumulative sales volume.

In contrast, the Average of Volume Sales by Author calculates the average sales per book for each author, providing insight into how well each individual book performs on average. 
While an author may have a high total book sales volume due to multiple titles, their average sales per book might be lower compared to another author with fewer but more consistently successful books.

This comparison is crucial as it differentiates between prolific authors who may have many moderately successful books and authors who consistently achieve higher sales with fewer releases.

Same analysis can be applied for Top 5 Publishers and Top 5 Genres also.
